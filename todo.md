# Mama's Pantry — Build Todo
> Aligned to webapp_spec.pdf (v1.0). Spec defines 6 phases; we track by feature area.

---

## Monorepo Restructure ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — workspaces: `apps/*`, `packages/*`
- [x] Root `package.json` — private workspace root, `dev:web`, `dev:admin`, `build:*`, `typecheck` scripts
- [x] `.npmrc` — `shamefully-hoist=false`, build approvals for esbuild/sharp/unrs-resolver
- [x] `.gitignore` — updated for monorepo paths
- [x] `apps/web/` (`@mamas-pantry/web`) — all Next.js source moved here, builds and typechecks clean
- [x] `packages/types/` (`@mamas-pantry/types`) — shared interfaces: Product, Order, User, Shipment, PreOrder, PromoCode
- [x] `ProductCategory` corrected to `imported|local|chilled|household`; `is_mums_pick` boolean added to Product type
- [x] `Order` type updated: `confirmed` status, `delivery_fee_ngn`, `payment_status`, `payment_ref`
- [x] `apps/web/lib/api.ts` — all domain types imported from `@mamas-pantry/types`
- [x] `apps/admin/` (`@mamas-pantry/admin`) — React 19 + Vite + TanStack Query + Recharts + React Router v7, brand tokens, proxy to `:8000`, builds clean
- [x] `backend/` stays at root, managed independently

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Verify-phone page (built for OTP; switched to email verification — page still exists)

---

## Phase 2 — Backend Schema Revisions (needed before continuing)

### Products model changes
- [x] Change `ProductCategory` enum from `mums_pick|local|imported` → `imported|local|chilled|household`
- [x] Add `is_mums_pick` boolean field (independent of category — a product can be `imported` AND `is_mums_pick=true`)
